# digital-timestamp

Sometimes you do not need to digital timestamp files with the standard tools like signtool.exe, instead you need to obtain the timestamp and save it in a different place.

This is a demonstration project to digital time-stamp files with the common certification authorities(CA) by using standard and public tools like:
  - OpenSSL
  - curl
